# hello-world
This "hello-world" repository  is gonna be a place where I store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.
My name is **Marina Perdiguero**, I'm from *MÃ¡laga, Spain* and I came to Park University to get my degree while doing what I like the most, playing basketball.
